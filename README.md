# Blue Print:

As I have been assigned the project on 21st August 2021 .On the 21st August 2021 I  explored the original website, understood the building
architecture of the website and the website working flow. After doing these things I made
my plan in what flow I have to complete this and also decided a deadline from my side.
Deciding the deadline helped a lot to build this website clone on time.

# Day By Day Plan:
